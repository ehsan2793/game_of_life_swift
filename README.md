Conway's Game of Life in Swift
Description
This is a Swift implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The game consists of a grid of cells that can be in one of two states, alive or dead. The state of each cell evolves over time based on a set of rules.

Installation
To run the project, simply download or clone the repository and open it in Xcode. You can then run the project directly from Xcode or from the command line.

Usage
Once the project is running, you can observe the evolution of the cells on the grid. The simulation will continue indefinitely, with each generation of cells being calculated based on the previous generation.
